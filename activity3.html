    <h2> 8 LETTERS</h2>
    <p> You know me the best<br>
        You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge<br>
        That right there is the scariest feeling<br>
        Opening and closing up again<br>
        I've been hurt, so I don't trust<br>
        Now here we are, staring at the ceiling<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
        I've said those words before, but it was a lie<br>
        And you deserve to hear them a thousand times<br>
    </p>
    <p>If all it is is eight letters<br>
        Why is it so hard to say?<br>
        If all it is is eight letters<br>
        Why am I in my own way?<br>
        Why do I pull you close?<br>
        And then ask you for space<br>
        If all it is is eight letters<br>
        Why is it so hard to say?<br>
        </p>
    <p>Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align?<br>
        When your hand's in mine<br>
        It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign?<br>
        I should speak my mind<br>
    </p>
